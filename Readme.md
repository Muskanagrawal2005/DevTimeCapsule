DevTimeCapsule ðŸ§ ðŸ“¦

DevTimeCapsule is an AI-powered Chrome extension that silently tracks your daily developer activity â€” websites visited, code copied, questions solved â€” and generates a smart AI-written learning journal with a single click. It's your personal developer diary, helping you reflect, stay accountable, and grow consistently.

*   Time Spent Analysis: Measures how much time you spend on each tracked platform.
    
*   Code & Question Logging: Logs the coding questions you open and the code you copy or write.
    
*   AI-Generated Learning Journal: Summarizes your daily activity into a reflective entry using GPT-style summarization.

HOW THE AI WORKS

The extension logs your activity throughout the day. When you click the icon:

*   It gathers logs of visited pages, time spent, and any copied code.
    
*   It detects patterns like topic focus (e.g., dynamic programming).
    
*   It generates a journal entry like:  
    "You spent 1.5 hours today solving recursion and backtracking problems on LeetCode. You also browsed async patterns on GitHub. Great progress!"
    

You can read it, reflect on your progress, or copy it to a journal platform.

EXAMPLE USE CASE

Letâ€™s say today you:

*   Visited GitHub repositories on async/await
    
*   Spent 2 hours total on developer websites
    

When you click the extension, your DevTimeCapsule entry might look like:

"Today, you practiced LeetCode problems focusing on binary trees and recursion. You also explored async handling patterns in JavaScript through GitHub and Stack Overflow. Keep up the consistent learning!"
